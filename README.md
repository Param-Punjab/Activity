# [11-7-2024] 1st Day of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering Collage

Today marked the beginning of our journey at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. We kicked off the day with a prayer at the college Gurudwara Sahib, which added a special touch to our start. Faculty members, including the college's former principal who is also an alumnus, shared their wisdom and encouraged us. They emphasized the importance of staying clam and attentive with the message, "no tension and full attention". Additionally, several alumni recounted their experiences, warning us about common mistakes made during their collage days. Overall, we had a wonderful first day, filled with valuable insights and knowledge.
